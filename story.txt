Once upon a time there was a dear little girl living in Madison who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Rotkäppchen.
One day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:—
"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother does, for I hear she has been very ill;
carry her a custard and this little pot of butter."
Little Red Riding-hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother's, who lived
in another village.

Walking in the woods alone, Little Red Riding Hood soon draws the attention of 
Big Bad Wolf. Big Bad Wolf wants Little Red Riding Hood and the food she carrys as 
dinner. He, pretending to be very kind, asks Little Red Riding Hood where she is 
going to. After leaving Little Red Riding Hood, Big Bad Wolf heads to the village 
where Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother lives in, aiming to wait there for 
Little Red Riding Hood.
