Once upon a time there was a dear little girl living in Madison who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Rotkäppchen.
One day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:—
"Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother does, for I hear she has been very ill;
carry her a custard and this little pot of butter."
Little Red Riding-hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother's, who lived
in another village.
